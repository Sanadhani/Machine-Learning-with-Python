Course Highlights:

- This course introduced me to a wide range of machine learning techniques, starting with supervised and unsupervised learning.
- I then moved on to learn about regression analysis, which included linear regression (both simple and multiple), nonlinear regression, and model evaluation.
- I also explored various classification methods, such as K-nearest neighbours, decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines.
- Clustering techniques were another key area, where I learned about partition-based, hierarchical, and density-based clustering methods.
- The course concluded with recommender systems, covering both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches.
